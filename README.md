# Phase Uniformity Measurement with Polarimetry Method
MATLAB auto-testbench for measuring spatial phase non-uniformity of LCoS-SLM devices.

Written with MATLAB R2022a, should also work with R2020a+ I guess. Oscilloscope is PicoScope PS5000a (official driver provided by PicoScope), and translation stage is from Thorlabs (custom written MATLAB driver code at https://github.com/ExplodingONC/Thorlabs_Linear_Translation_Stage).

Be careful, the data file can easily reach up to several GBs
